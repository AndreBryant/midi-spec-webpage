# midi-spec-webpage
This is a front-end redesign of the [Updated Standard MIDI-File Format Spec. 1.1](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt306/StandardMIDIfileformat.html).

It is a static webpage and only uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The page was deployed via GitHub Pages and can be visited through [this link](https://embryzon.github.io/midi-spec-webpage).
